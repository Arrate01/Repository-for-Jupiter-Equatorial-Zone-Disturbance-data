# Repository-for-Jupiter-Equatorial-Zone-Disturbance-data
Antuñano et al. (2018) used Jupiter infrared data captured by 8 different ground-based instruments mounted on the Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF) on Maunakea and Very Large Telescope (VLT) in Paranal between 1984 and 2017, to investigate a pattern of cloud clearance events at Jupiter's equatorial zone at 5 µm. This repository contains (i) cylindrical maps of Jupiter's 5-µm images, showing the Equatorial Zone disturbance, used to build Figure 1 and Figure 3, and (ii) a data file showing the brightness scans from ±7° latitude as a function of time.
